With time to think, this creative and motivated woman combined two traditional gifts ~flowers and sweets~ and turned them into one deliciously clever concept, the cookie bouquet. Her edible bouquets of custom-shaped and hand-decorated sugar and cinnamon brown sugar cookies on sticks were cleverly arranged in baskets as tasteful gifts for any occasion.Gift-givers quickly embraced the new idea, and Gwen's budding enterprise soon outgrew her own home kitchen.The newly successful entrepreneur moved to a location in nearby, Tulsa, Oklahoma. Then in 1986 when things really picked up, Gwen moved her business to Dallas, Texas.After the Dallas business was established, Gwen turned her attention to the numerous requests from others wishing to start their own Cookie Bouquet franchise. The first franchised Cookie Bouquet location opened in 1987 and the momentum has been growing ever since. To better reflect all of the creative, unique and customized products sold, Cookie Bouquet locations changed their names to \"Cookies by Design\" in 2004. Now, 30 years later, approximately 100 Cookies by Design locations are operating across the United States.Our Cookies by Design locations service all your cookie needs, from Father's Day Gift Baskets to birthday gift baskets, we can accommodate all holiday and special occasion gift needs!",

This includes a copy of the agency notice, a copy of their most recent Performance Rating and a copy of their most recent SF-50 noting current position, grade level, and duty location.Qualified NASA term employees who have term conversion eligibility under the NASA Flexibility Act of 2004 will be referred and considered equally with other NASA permanent employees under internal competitive placement procedures.Your USAJOBS account asks you to assign a name to each of your resumes.

If you wish to keep track of that information, we recommend you make note of it at the time you apply.Fair Employment Opportunities for ApplicantsNASA Credit for National ServiceResumes will be rated by an automated system (Resumix) that matches the competencies extracted from the candidate's resume to the competencies identified by the selecting official for the position. Candidates will be evaluated on the competencies they possess that are directly related to the duties of the job, as described in the announcement. Candidates should refer to NASA's Applicant Guide for assistance in developing a complete resume, as NASA will not accept separate KSA statements.Qualified candidates will be assigned to one of three quality levels based on the degree to which their competencies meet the duties required. A human resources specialist will validate the qualifications of those candidates eligible to be referred to the selecting official. For the purpose of the Career Transition Assistance Program (CTAP) and the Interagency Career Transition Assistance Program (ICTAP), candidates rated in the top quality level are considered well-qualified.To receive consideration, you must submit a resume and answer NASA-specific questions. The NASA questions appear after you submit your resume and are transferred to the NASA web site. If you successfully apply, USAJOBS will show your application status as 'Received'. If your status is 'Application Status Not Available', you have not successfully applied. Do not rely on a USAJOBS email to confirm successful application. Only an email from NASA confirms a successful application.NASA's application process has been specifically developed to ensure that we only ask you for the information we absolutely need to evaluate your qualifications and eligibility. In order to apply for this position, you only need to submit your resume and answer the screening questions and supplemental information. No additional documentation is accepted at the time of application. (For example you need not submit narrative 'KSA' statements; they are not required and will not be evaluated.) In this way we allow you to focus on preparing a resume that best describes your background and abilities. For assistance in preparing your resume, consult the Applicant Guide. Nothing further is required until requested by the Human Resources Office. At that point, we may ask you to submit documentation to support statements made in your resume. For example, we may ask you to provide academic transcripts or proof of Federal employment status. If you are claiming veterans' preference, we may ask you to submit proof of veterans preference (DD-214, and, if claiming 10-point preference, SF-15 plus proof required by that form).

For us, this means doing the right thing even when it is the difficult thing. We live these ideals by providing jobs that pay above the minimum wage with good benefits and 401Ks. We also do this by occasionally taking a stand on what some may consider controversial issues that we feel are important to us both as a business and as people. When we take these stands, we do so under the Farmgirl Flowers brand. As an employee, we understand these views may be associated with you simply by your employment with us.
